Pokémon Johto Legends

A custom Pokémon ROM Hack based on the pokecrystal16 16-bit expansion
of Pokémon Crystal created by aaaaaa123456789.

This is a prequel to Pokémon Crystal, where you play as either Draco or
Dahlia, and travel the Johto Region, collect the eight badges, and discover
a conspiracy to take over the region from the shadows.


Features

Thanks to the expansion, we were able to go beyond the usual 256 limit, and
now there are 323 Pokémon from Generations 1-4, 6, 8, and 9, as well as several
Fakemon. There are also 406 moves, ranging from Generations 1-9, and a few
original moves.

There are four versions: Original, Faithful, No PSS and Challenge. Faithful version
does not have the type-changes, while No PSS also does not have the type changes
nor the Physical/Special Split. Challenge Mode has level-caps, the inability to use items in trainer battles, no EVs,
and higher IVs for opponents.

Moves have been altered to fit their more modern versions.

Added the Fairy-type, Running Shoes, B2W2 Repel system, infinite use TMs.

game.

Download and Play

Download a ROM of Crystal with the name: Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.1) [C][!]

It has to be v1.1 for the patch to work.

Challenge:

Patch the ROM with the patch, and it is all set.

If you want to build it yourself, follow the regular steps for cloning a repository
and use rgbds v0.4.1.

Please use an accurate emulator, such as BGB64 or mGBA. BGB64 is a debugger, and
thus you will need to run without breaks, and can be done by pressing
Shift + F9. Otherwise, you will be interrupted constantly. Emulators such as
VBA and MyOldBoy will not emulate the hack correctly.
