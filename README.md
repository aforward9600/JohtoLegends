Pokémon Johto Legends

A custom Pokémon ROM Hack based on the pokecrystal16 16-bit expansion
of Pokémon Crystal created by aaaaaa123456789.

This is a prequel to Pokémon Crystal, where you play as either Draco or
Dahlia, and travel the Johto Region, collect the eight badges, and discover
a conspiracy to take over the region from the shadows.


Features

Thanks to the expansion, we were able to go beyond the usual 256 limit, and
now there are 323 Pokémon from Generations 1-4, 6, 8, and 9, as well as several
Fakemon. There are also 405 moves, ranging from Generations 1-9, and a few
original moves.

There are three versions: Original, Faithful and Challenge. Faithful version
does not have the type-changes, nor the Physical/Special Split. Challenge
Mode has level-caps, the inability to use items in trainer battles, no EVs,
and higher IVs for opponents.

Moves have been altered to fit their more modern versions.

Physical/Special Split.

Added the Fairy-type, Running Shoes, B2W2 Repel system, infinite use TMs.

Pokémon Glazed inspired rematch system with certain trainers.

Increased and altered base stats for Pokémon that originally had sub-500 BST.

Altered typings and movepools to increase usability.

New items to evolve Pokémon that had unique evolutions in the original
game.

70 TMs and 17 Move Tutor Moves.

New locations.

New music.

New trainer sprites and classes.

A list of major gameplay changes can be found in the file 



Download and Play

Download a ROM of Crystal with the name: Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.1) [C][!]

It has to be v1.1 for the patch to work.

Below is a link to the current patch, Version 0.4.5.2 Beta.

https://www.mediafire.com/file/u0zbpjjljsl8tco/johtolegendsv0.4.5.2.ips/file

Faithful:

Challenge:

Patch the ROM with the patch, and it is all set.

Please use an accurate emulator, such as BGB64 or mGBA. BGB64 is a debugger, and
thus you will need to run without breaks, and can be done by pressing
Shift + F9. Otherwise, you will be interrupted constantly. Emulators such as
VBA and MyOldBoy will not emulate the hack correctly.

If you are knowledgeable on downloading Github depositories, then feel free
to clone and make the ROM from the repository.
